Monitors publish availability and collects related metrics. Collected metrics are sent to various systems (ex. Splunk).

# Usage
It requires go1.5.

The dependencies are managed by [Godep](https://github.com/tools/godep).

`export GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1`

`go get github.com/Financial-Times/publish-availability-monitor`

`publish-availability-monitor -config=int-config.json`

With Docker:

`docker build -t coco/publish-availability-monitor .`

`docker run -ti --env QUEUE_ADDR=<addr> --env URLS=<endpoint1>,<endpoint2> coco/publish-availability-monitor`

# Puppet module
If you want a new puppet module version:
* manually increment the version in `puppet/ft-publish_availability_monitor/Modulefile`
* create a `git tag <version>` corresponding to the module version

# Build and deploy
### UCS
* build puppet module using the Jenkins job `publish-availability-monitor-build`
* deploy the puppet module using the Jenkins job `publish-availability-monitor-deploy`

# Configuration

```
